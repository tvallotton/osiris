    /// Setting the event interval determines the effective "priority" of delivering
    /// these external events (which may wake up additional tasks), compared to
    /// executing tasks that are currently ready to run. A smaller value is useful
    /// when tasks frequently spend a long time in polling, or frequently yield,
    /// which can result in overly long delays picking up I/O events. Conversely,
    /// picking up new events requires extra synchronization and syscall overhead,
    /// so if tasks generally complete their polling quickly, a higher event interval
    /// will minimize that overhead while still keeping the scheduler responsive to
    /// events.
